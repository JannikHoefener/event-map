### Sprint 1

Sprint 1 includes 3 units:

Unit 1: Introduction to HCI
Unit 2: Ideation / Design Thinking
Unit 3: Requirements Analysis

Tasks / Exercises:

Build a team and register it on moodle.
Find an app idea (using a Brainstorming/Ideation technique).
Create a first sketch of your app idea.
Explain your idea to others and show the sketch. Collect Feedback.
Conduct a PACT analysis for your app idea.
Create ate least 1 persona for your app idea.
Describe the 1-3 main scenarios of your app idea.
Derive user stories from your scenarios.

The following artifacts need to be submitted at the end as part of the project:

Documentation of ideation phase
First description and first sketch of the app idea
PACT analysis
Persona
Scenarios
User Stories

### Sprint 2

Sprint 2 includes 2 units:

Unit 4: Prototyping
Unit 5: User Studies

Tasks / Exercises:

Based on your scenarios and user stories, build an "interactive" paper prototype of your app idea
Test this prototype: Choose a method, acquire 5 test users, ask them to do specific tasks in your app, collect feedback

The following artifacts need to be submitted at the end as part of the project:

Pictures of Paper Prototype
Documentation of User Testing & Analysis of Feedback

### Sprint 3

Sprint 3 includes 2 units:

Unit 6: Interaction Design
Unit 7: Wireframes

Tasks / Exercises:

With your Figma account, join the IAS2025/2026 team by using this invite link.
Create a new Project inside of the IAS2025/2026 team and name it like your app
Based on your paper prototype, build a digital wireframe prototype with Figma
Test this prototype: Choose a method, acquire 5 test users, ask them to do specific tasks in your app, collect feedback

The following artifacts need to be submitted at the end as part of the project:

Screenshots of Figma Prototype
Justification of Interaction Design in the Figma Prototype: On which pattern, heursitc, standard or guideline are the different design decisions in your prototype based?
Documentation of User Testing & Analysis of Feedback

### Sprint 4

Sprint 4 includes 2 units:

Unit 8: Introduction to ReactNative
Unit 9: Advanced ReactNative

Tasks / Exercises:

Build non-interactive screens of your app in ReactNative
Build interactive screens of your app in ReactNative. It should be possible to jump from one screen to another. It is not necessary that there is more functionality / logic behind the screens.

The following artifacts need to be submitted at the end as part of the project:

Screenshots of non-interactive screens designed in ReactNative

### Sprint 5

Sprint 5 includes 1 unit:

Unit 10: Human Factors

Tasks / Exercises:

Refine your prototype even further, add small interactions (such as using forms, drag& drop, lists, swiping, etc.). Please pay attention to human factors and gestalt laws when implementing UI and interactions. Add sounds and vibrations if needed.

### Sprint 6

Sprint 6 includes 1 unit:

Unit 11: Heursitic Evaluation

Tasks / Exercises:

Finish a final click-dummy prototype of your app
All UI elements should be functional / interactive
Reactions to user actions can be "faked" / not use "real" data
Conduct a heuristic evaluation by using a chat-based large language model such as ChatGPT, Gemini or MS Copilot as an expert reviewer
Use the screenshots of your ReactNative prototype and a description of the flow between the screens as input for the AI
Choose a heursitic or guideline from Unit 6 (such as Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules, Nielsen's 10 Heuristics, ISO Standard, ... or any other appropriate checklist)
Define user tasks to be performed in the app (e.g., “Register,” “Complete purchase,” “Change settings”).
Example prompt could be: "Here are 5 screenshots of the XYZ mobile app, plus a brief description of the main flow. Please conduct a heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's 10 heuristics and provide specific usability issues and suggestions for improvement."
You could also ask for recommendations for redesign
Analyze the results of the AI-based heuristic evaluation and critically reflect what is useful and what is not useful. Be aware that the AI might not always be right!
Conduct a usability testing with the click-dummy prototype of your app
Find 5 test users
Let them do concrete tasks in your app
Observe their actions and note down usability problems
Ask them to "think aloud" and take notes
After using the app, ask them several open "w"-questions about the usability of your app
Analyze the data
Address/fix the core usability problems that arised out of both evaluations.

The following artifacts need to be submitted at the end as part of the project:

Heuristic Evaluation
Input prompt & used AI-chatbot
Results / Recommendations of the heuristic evaluation
Your thoughts on the AI-results
User Evaluation
Description of tasks that the user needed to do
Summary of your notes and their answers
Analysis of core usability problems that you need to address
Vdeo of clicking through all functionalities of the final click-dummy prototype of your app
